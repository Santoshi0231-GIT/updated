# Advanced Features: Content-Based Filtering & Location Services

This document outlines the advanced features implemented in the Plateful backend system.

## ü§ñ Content-Based Filtering System

### Overview
The content-based filtering system analyzes user preferences and behavior to provide personalized food recommendations. It uses sophisticated algorithms to match users with food items based on their order history, preferences, and contextual factors.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Personalized Recommendations**
- Analyzes user order history (last 50 orders)
- Considers multiple factors: categories, sub-categories, price range, spice levels, ingredients, ratings
- Weighted scoring algorithm with configurable weights
- Filters out previously ordered items to ensure variety

#### 2. **Similarity-Based Recommendations**
- Finds similar items based on content features
- Uses multi-dimensional similarity scoring
- Considers price range, category, ingredients, and ratings

#### 3. **Time-Based Recommendations**
- Recommends items based on current time of day
- Morning: Breakfast items, light snacks
- Afternoon: Lunch items, regular meals
- Evening: Dinner items, hearty meals
- Night: Light snacks, desserts

#### 4. **Context-Aware Filtering**
- Considers user's preferred order times
- Accounts for seasonal preferences
- Adapts to user's dietary restrictions and allergens

```javascript
preferences = {
  categories: { veg: 15, non-veg: 5 },
  subCategories: { 'veg-snacks': 10, 'regular-lunch': 8 },
  priceRange: { min: 50, max: 300 },
  spiceLevel: { medium: 12, hot: 3 },
  avgRating: 4.2,
  frequentIngredients: { rice: 8, chicken: 5 },
  timePreferences: { evening: 12, afternoon: 6 }
}
```

#### Similarity Scoring
```javascript
Score = (
  categoryScore * 0.25 +
  subCategoryScore * 0.20 +
  priceScore * 0.15 +
  spiceScore * 0.10 +
  ratingScore * 0.15 +
  ingredientScore * 0.10 +
  allergenScore * 0.05
) / totalWeight
```

## üìç Location Services with Haversine Algorithm

### Overview
The location service provides accurate distance calculations and delivery zone management using the Haversine formula. It enables dynamic delivery fee calculation, delivery area validation, and route optimization.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Haversine Distance Calculation**
- Calculates great-circle distances between two points on Earth
- Accounts for Earth's curvature for accurate results
- Precision up to 2 decimal places

#### 2. **Dynamic Delivery Zones**
- **Zone 1**: 0-5km (Free delivery)
- **Zone 2**: 5-10km (‚Çπ30 delivery fee)
- **Zone 3**: 10-15km (‚Çπ60 delivery fee)
- **Zone 4**: 15-25km (‚Çπ100 delivery fee)
- Maximum delivery distance: 25km

#### 3. **Smart Delivery Fee Calculation**
- Distance-based pricing
- Free delivery for orders above ‚Çπ500
- Automatic zone detection
- Delivery time estimation

#### 4. **Address Geocoding**
- Converts addresses to coordinates
- Supports major cities (expandable)
- Validates delivery areas

### API Endpoints

#### Get Delivery Information
```
POST /api/location/delivery-info
Body: {
  "latitude": 27.7172,
  "longitude": 85.3240,
  "orderTotal": 600
}
```

#### Check Delivery Availability
```
POST /api/location/check-deliverable
Body: {
  "latitude": 27.7172,
  "longitude": 85.3240
}
```

#### Get Delivery Zones
```
GET /api/location/delivery-zones
```

#### Calculate Distance
```
POST /api/location/calculate-distance
Body: {
  "from": { "latitude": 27.7172, "longitude": 85.3240 },
  "to": { "latitude": 27.6683, "longitude": 85.3206 }
}
```

#### Geocode Address
```
POST /api/location/geocode
Body: {
  "address": "Kathmandu, Nepal"
}
```

### Haversine Formula Implementation

```javascript
function calculateHaversineDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
  const R = 6371; // Earth's radius in kilometers
  const dLat = toRadians(lat2 - lat1);
  const dLon = toRadians(lon2 - lon1);
  
  const a = Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
            Math.cos(toRadians(lat1)) * Math.cos(toRadians(lat2)) *
            Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2);
  
  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
  return R * c;
}
```

### Delivery Time Estimation

```javascript
estimatedTime = preparationTime + deliveryTime + bufferTime
where:
- preparationTime = 20 minutes (base)
- deliveryTime = (distance / 30 km/h) * 60 minutes
- bufferTime = min(distance * 2, 15) minutes
```

  address: "Your Restaurant Address"
};
```

### Delivery Zone Customization
```javascript
static DELIVERY_ZONES = {
  zone1: { maxDistance: 5, fee: 0, name: "Free Delivery Zone" },
